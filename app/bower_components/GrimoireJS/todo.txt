Pathfinder magic item automatic roller
To do:

* I'm getting a problem where the random number generator is reliably getting the SAME item from a weighted list and I'm not sure why.
 = This is occuring for getHumanoid, getOutsider, getDeity, and several other lowest level methods
   when called from higher order functions like getIntelligence or getWeapon
 = This isn't happening anymore but i'm not sure why. I think that chance was getting re-seeded somewhere
* I'm occasionally getting a bug where selectSource will claim that it can't find a source for major Scrolls
